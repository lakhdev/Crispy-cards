                    <p id="about">The main page for the website will have banners with different images represing what we sell as well as bits of information such as benchmark tests advertising the products.
I have decided to use ‘Adobe Arabic Regular’ Font because i believe it gives the website a bold look as well as make it look slick and nished.
The website theme for all pages is a smooth black and grey background with a nvidia logo in the middle of it. This gives the website a nished and polished feel to it instead of having a plain white background
which was the original idea.
The banners on the main page will be able to move around instead of placing alot of images on the main home page and making it look clustered. Not lling the page with alot of information i believe was a good
idea as it grabs the users attention and adding more pages and content will allow the website to have a more professional feel to it and make it more user friendly
The product page has a very simple and sophisticated look. With information on each product in order of price range.
Choosing the white font allows the user to easily see the information on the page and having the easy to look at grey background makes it even more easier to see. The informaiton of the products shows eveyrth- ing the customer will want to look at before purchasing.
The white background over the images allows you to get a good look of the product, as for the writing it is easy enough to see without a background and also looks better without one. The smallprint on the prod- uct details also makes the products look more realistic.
This page is opened when a customer clicks on the product they are wanting to look at. It enlarges the image so the user can see it better, and also shows more product information.
For most people who look at the product inforation this will be very useful, especially if you are going to buy the product every detail can come in handy. For example dimentions of the graphics card are shown to
see if the product will t in the customers computer.
There is also an add to basket option which will take you to the basket page where you will be able to checkout and nish buying the product.
The about page shows the headquarters of the business as well as directions to it (if this is allowed). It will serve as an information page for the business including contact information.
Information of the businesses history is also included in the about page, this is to show the customer that the website is ocial and give them an incite of what to expect service wise from the business.
The map shows the location of the business and an adress so the user will be able to locate the business if they so choose too.
I believe adding information about the business also makes the customer feel more safe when purchasing from the site, as again it makes it more ocial less like a website where you are likely to get scammed.
This page shows the products you are wanting to buy from the website, it has a very simplistic style to it with alot of space around the information making it easy for the user to see. This means that there will hope-fully be no mistakes in the products purchased.
I believe it also makes the website look more professional and less like somehting that will scam you.
There is also a proceed to checkout option where you will be able to nalise your sale.
Finally there is a checkout page, where you will be able to input all your personal information, allowing the website to store this information in exchange for completing the order.
The page looks very polished and proessional with little to look at making it easy and simple to use.
I have kept the theme of the website similar all the way through to the end, using the same style buttons and font so that it looks more elegant and professional</p>
